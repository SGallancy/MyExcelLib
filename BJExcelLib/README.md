This is a project for me to try out how github works. This is a personal library of several UDFs I use at work. Feel free to use it, but there are no guarantees or rights that can be derived of this.

This library is still a work in progress; several functions can be improved upon (or might even be outright wrong). Time permitting, I might fix some of those, but this is not a high-priority project for me right now.
